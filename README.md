The main functionality of the game is to guide the COVID VIRUS to "eat" more virus on the game board, resulting in the COVID SNAKE getting longer gradually. The game will end when the snake hits the wall or gets too long to the point that its head collides with its body.

More advanced functionality that we would love to include are: 1. increase the speed of the snake as the snake gets longer, 2. increase the amount of food on the game board, 3. add the music, and so on.
